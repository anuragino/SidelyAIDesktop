## Unresolved Issue: Data Not Being Stored in Database via API Endpoint
While testing the Windows Desktop Application, there is an issue where data submitted through the application's API endpoint is not being stored in the database, **despite the endpoint functioning correctly when tested with Postman**.
Unfortunately, I have **my end-term exam tomorrow** and need to focus on studying, so I won't be able to fix the bug today.
